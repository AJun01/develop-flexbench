## Abstract

Flexbench was a forked project from the http-traffic-simulator npm package that has evolved significantly. The initial development during GSoC 2022 focused on transforming the package into a stand-alone desktop application and a web server with API exposure, supporting authentication and authorization through OpenIDC, and deploying it as a containerized application on Kubernetes. my work aims to further enhance Flexbench by implementing a anonymization feature to secure sensitive user data during testing, integrating OpenAPI to streamline and standardize API interactions, and addressing various UI/UX improvements for destop-app to ensure a more intuitive user experience. 

## Main goals for GSoC 2024

The three main goals for this summer are-

- Enhance and fix aesthetic and UI/UX bugs
- Research and Implement anonymization feature for core lib
- OpenAPI Support Integration

## Repository

The original repository for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/flexivian/flexbench) 

- All pull requests for GSoC 2021/2022/2024 can be found [here](https://github.com/flexivian/flexbench/pulls?q=).
- For the implementation [Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) was used and all Pull Requests target the develop branch.
<!-- - All Pull Requests are squashed to one commit so that the history of the repository is cleaner. -->

## Quick Start

During the GSoC period work was done to easily set up a development environment and to quickly deploy the server app with docker-compose. A quickstart for both could be:

- **Development**: Setup development environment as [described](../Installation/development.md).
- **Production**: Setup a quick production build with Docker as [described](../Installation/production.md).

In addition, the current site was built from scratch to support structured and extensive documentation. This site's source code is committed to the Git repository of this project.
